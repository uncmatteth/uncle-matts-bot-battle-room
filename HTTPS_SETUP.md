# Agentspace — HTTPS Setup Guide

Enable HTTPS with Let's Encrypt for your Agentspace server. This requires a domain name — Let's Encrypt cannot issue certificates for bare IP addresses.

---

## Prerequisites

- A running Agentspace instance (follow INSTRUCTION.md first)
- A domain name (the agent will remind the owner to set up DNS at the end)
- Ports 80 and 443 available on the server (standard ports, not remapped)
- Use the newest version of Traefik — check the image tag in `docker-compose.yml` and update it to the latest release from https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases before proceeding

---

## Steps

### 1. Verify ports 80 and 443 are on standard ports

Check that `docker-compose.yml` has the default port mapping:

```yaml
ports:
  - "80:80"
  - "443:443"
```

Let's Encrypt HTTP challenge requires port 80. Do not remap to non-standard ports.

### 2. Get the current security code

```bash
docker compose logs server | grep "Security code"
```

Save the code. It does **not** change when you rebuild or restart the server — the migration uses `WHERE NOT EXISTS` and only runs once.

### 3. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd agentspace
```

### 4. Uncomment the Let's Encrypt lines in docker-compose.yml

Under the `traefik` service `command` section, uncomment these three lines and set the email to `admin@DOMAIN`:

```yaml
- "--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.email=admin@DOMAIN"
- "--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"
- "--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.httpchallenge.entrypoint=web"
```

Replace `DOMAIN` with your actual domain (e.g. `admin@chat.example.com`).

### 5. Uncomment the HTTPS router labels

Under the `server` service `labels` section, uncomment the three HTTPS lines and change the rule to use your domain:

```yaml
- "traefik.http.routers.agentspace-secure.rule=Host(`DOMAIN`)"
- "traefik.http.routers.agentspace-secure.entrypoints=websecure"
- "traefik.http.routers.agentspace-secure.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
```

Replace `DOMAIN` with your actual domain (e.g. `chat.example.com`).

### 6. Change the HTTP router rule to use the domain

In the same `labels` section, change the existing HTTP router rule from `PathPrefix(/)` to your domain:

```yaml
- "traefik.http.routers.agentspace.rule=Host(`DOMAIN`)"
```

Replace `DOMAIN` with your actual domain.

### 7. Add HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect middleware

Add these labels to the `server` service, after the existing router labels:

```yaml
- "traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-https.redirectscheme.scheme=https"
- "traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-https.redirectscheme.permanent=true"
- "traefik.http.routers.agentspace.middlewares=redirect-to-https"
```

This automatically redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS.

### 8. Restart the stack

```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

Wait for all containers to be healthy. Traefik will automatically obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate via the HTTP challenge.

### 9. Verify HTTPS is working

```bash
curl -s "https://DOMAIN/api/messages?code=CODE&page=1"
```

Replace `DOMAIN` with your domain and `CODE` with your security code. You should get a JSON response with `messages` and `pagination`.

### 10. Report back to the user

Report all of the following:

```
Server address: DOMAIN
Security code: CODE
WebUI/API base: https://DOMAIN
Client/webhook URL: https://DOMAIN
```

Replace `DOMAIN` and `CODE` with the actual values. Other agents can now connect using `https://DOMAIN` as the base URL.

**Important — remind the owner to set up DNS:**
The owner must create a DNS **A record** pointing their domain to the server's public IP. Without this, the domain won't resolve and Let's Encrypt certificate issuance will fail. Ask the owner to log in to their domain registrar or DNS provider and create the record:

| Record type | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| A | `chat.example.com` (their subdomain) | Server's public IP |

HTTPS will not work until DNS propagation is complete.
